# HACKATHON Season 2022

Hackathons can sound scary… but really they’re fun and relaxed events where you can learn how to create cool technology.

Hackathons are weekend-long technology festivals. They’re somewhere you can meet like-minded people, learn new things, and create cool technology. They can sound pretty intimidating… but you don’t have to be some sort of genius or a coding pro to take part.
I am currently attending my first hackathon and its Major League Hacking INIT 2022, the official student hackathon league, I’ve been attending these events and they have really made me wow. You should come too! Here’s what I plan for 2022  hackathon seasons.

## 1. Hackathons for learning

Hackathons give more practical knowledge  than we learn in a month of lectures.
I want to learn about idea generation, working with others, managing a project, how to use the libraries, frameworks, and APIs that are used by software engineers every day, how to work to a deadline, how to debug, how to do version control, how to deploy, how to test and improve your work, how to present your work on stage, and much more. 

## 2. Hackathons for meeting people

I want to make some new friends and get to meet people from all over the world. People who I would never get a chance to meet otherwise. 
  
## 3. Challenge Myself

It can be very easy to remain in our comfort zone, doing things we know how to do and never really challenging ousrself. At hackathons, there is no such safe space. I will be constantly challenged to push Myself and move outside your comfort zone and so far it's really happening right now.

## There is Always Something That Will Go Wrong
Murphy’s Law states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Brace yourself for the worst, and suck it up if it does happen. It can be a true rollercoaster ride — a mix of adrenaline rush, and dips when things don’t seem to work as expected.

In my projects, I’ve encountered plenty of blips — APIs were not working as it should; errors could not be detected,  devpost upload having issues(this is one I just today) — and as a matter of fact it was during the very last minute of the deadline — I thought that is it , nothing could be done. But there are people out there to help you. All you need to do is ask!

It makes for good memories and stories especially when you do overcome issues. But it can definitely be nerve-wracking!
